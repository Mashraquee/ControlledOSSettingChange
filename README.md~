# Controlled OS Setting Change with Audit Logging

This project demonstrates how to perform a **controlled OS setting change** (simple, non-invasive) on an EGM-like system.  
We simulate setting the **timezone** by writing to a configuration file and logging an audit trail.

## Features
-  Controlled OS setting change (timezone)
-  Input validation
-  Configuration persistence (`config.json`)
-  Audit logging (`audit.log`)
-  Operator attribution and timestamp

## Example Command
```bash
